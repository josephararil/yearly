# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this repo is

**Yearly** is a mobile-first annual budgeting PWA: it tracks joint household spend in EUR
against a single per-year target and produces ranked, plain-language **callouts** that
explain whether you're on track and why. See `README.md` — it is the authoritative product +
design spec (data model, projection math, callout detectors, screens, design tokens). Treat
the README as the source of truth for *intended* behavior; treat the code below as the
*current* implementation.

> The README frames this bundle as a **design reference / prototype** to be recreated in a
> production stack (Vite/Next + Recharts + a real component library). The files here are a
> working prototype, not the production app.

## Visual layer: the "Broadsheet" restyle (complete)

The app is being reskinned from the old Aperture **dark** theme to **Broadsheet** — an
editorial light look (warm paper, hairline rules, three fonts, one terracotta accent). The
authoritative spec is `design/BROADSHEET_DESIGN_SPEC.md` with a runnable reference in
`design/reference/` (`broadsheet.html` + `lb-a.jsx` + `lb-data.jsx`). **This is a
visual-layer-only change — logic, data, projection math, the callout engine, routing, and
persistence are untouched.**

- **Phase 0 (done):** `y/tokens.css` defines the Broadsheet token set (`--paper`,
  `--ink`, `--ink-2`, `--muted`, `--hair`/`--hair-strong`, `--terra`/`--amber`/`--sage`,
  the `--chart-*` palette, and `--serif`/`--sans`/`--mono`). The three fonts (Newsreader /
  Hanken Grotesk / JetBrains Mono) are wired via a Google Fonts `<link>` in `index.html`.
- **Phase 1 (done):** **Overview** is restyled pixel-for-pixel to the reference:
  hero (no card, serif-`ink` number, over/under as a small mono `terra`/`sage` figure, a
  3px pace rule), "What's happening" callouts as hairline list rows with severity dots
  (terra/amber/sage) + faded serif "→", and a themed **Spend curve** (`SpendCurve` in
  `y/ui.jsx`). The Overview's old **Recent** transaction list was removed in favour of the
  Spend curve (matching the reference); transactions are still reachable on Analysis →
  Activity. Bottom nav is editorial text (mono labels, terra underline on active, an outline
  "+" circle).
- **Phase 1.5 (done):** **Shared primitives** restyled to Broadsheet (`y/ds.jsx` +
  `.ds-*` classes in `y/app.css`; `Sheet` + `Toast` in `y/ui.jsx`; form classes `.field` /
  `.inp` / `.inp-num`). All legacy token names replaced with canonical ones in touched rules.
  Button: terra fill / paper text / sans 600 (primary), transparent / hair border / ink
  (secondary). Chips: hair border; active = ink fill + paper text inversion. SegmentedControl:
  paper-tint track, paper active item, warm shadow. Inputs: transparent, hair border, terra
  focus ring, mono labels mono 11px uppercase muted, amount fields in mono. Sheet: paper
  surface, hair border, hair-strong grabber, warm scrim, `prefers-reduced-motion` guard.
  Toast: paper surface, hair-strong border, ink text, terra action. `DeltaChip` restyled to a
  bare mono terra/sage/amber inline figure (no background chip) for future reuse.
  SW cache bumped to `yearly-v5`.
- **Phase 2a (done):** **Add/Edit flow** (`y/addflow.jsx`) restyled to Broadsheet.
  Template tiles: multicolor filled icon chips replaced with calm 10px category color dots +
  label. Category picker: filled CatIcon squares replaced with 8px color dots. NumPad keys:
  canonical tokens (`--paper`, `--hair`, `--ink`, `--mono`), no shadows. DateField:
  `colorScheme` set to `"light"`. CSS: `.tpl`, `.tpl-dot`, `.tpl-name`, `.catpick-item`,
  `.catpick-item.sel`, `.cat-dot`, `.amount-display .cur` all updated to canonical tokens
  (`--paper`, `--hair`, `--hair-strong`, `--ink`, `--ink-2`, `--muted`, `--terra`); legacy
  `.tpl-ic` and `.catpick-item .cat-ic` removed. SW cache bumped to `yearly-v6`.
- **Phase 2b (done):** **Analysis** (`y/analysis.jsx`) restyled to Broadsheet.
  **ProjectionChart**: actual line/area locked to `--chart-actual` (terra) regardless of
  status — the "no red hero line" fix; projection → `--chart-proj` dashed "6 5" 2.2px;
  target → `--chart-target` dashed "4 4"; pace → `--chart-pace` dashed "2 4"; prior-year →
  `--chart-target` dashed; axis ticks mono `--chart-axis`; grid → `--chart-grid`.
  **ChartLegend**: all swatch colors updated to `--chart-*` palette; mono muted labels.
  **StatCards** (`.stat*`): filled grey cards dropped → flat hairline-separated figures;
  labels mono 10px uppercase muted, values mono ink, no card borders or radii.
  **CategoriesTab**: `CatIcon` chip replaced with 8px `cat-dot` color dot per category;
  catbar track height 3px in category color over `--hair` background; numbers mono; MoM
  delta uses canonical `--amber`/`--sage`. **TxRow** (shared in `y/ui.jsx`): `CatIcon`
  replaced with `cat-dot` color dot; `tx-meta` now mono `--muted`. All `.panel.panel-pad`
  wrappers removed from Projection, Categories, and Activity tabs — content sits directly
  on paper separated by `section-h` hairline rules. CSS: `.catbar-*`, `.txrow`, `.tx-*`
  updated to canonical tokens; `.stat*` rewritten as flat grid with hairline separators.
  Recharts engine not adopted — dependency-free SVG chart retained (same as SpendCurve).
  SW cache bumped to `yearly-v7`.
- **Phase 2c (done):** **Settings** (`y/settings.jsx`) restyled to Broadsheet.
  **Setting rows** (`.setrow*`): filled grey `.setrow-ic` tile removed — icon floats bare
  in `--ink-2`; titles sans `--ink`; sub-labels and values mono `--muted`; dividers `--hair`.
  **Year list** (`.year-row`): dividers `--hair`; "CURRENT" badge mono `--terra`; target /
  projection figures mono `--ink-2`; delta display switched from background `delta-chip` to
  bare `DeltaChip` component (mono, colored, no chip). **Range slider** (`.rng`): track is a
  terra-filled linear gradient driven by `--rng-fill` CSS variable (set inline from `v/15`);
  thumb is `--paper` with `1.5px --hair-strong` border, no heavy shadow. **Import preview**:
  `.chk` border `--hair-strong`, checked fill `--terra`; `.dupflag` mono `--amber`. **Category
  select pill** (`.selpill`): `--paper-tint` background, `--hair` border, `--sans` font, `--ink`
  text. **Templates**: `CatIcon` replaced with 8px `cat-dot` color dot. **DensitySheet**: active
  check `--terra`. All inline legacy token names (`--text`, `--text-2`, `--text-3`, `--accent`,
  `--font`, `--font-mono`, `--surface-sunk`, `--hairline`, `--hairline-strong`, `--watch`)
  replaced with canonical equivalents. SW cache bumped to `yearly-v8`.
- **Phase 3 (done):** **Consistency sweep.** All remaining legacy token usages replaced with
  canonical names throughout `y/app.css` and `y/app.jsx`: `.device` `--bg`→`--paper`;
  `.panel` `--surface`→`--paper`, `--hairline`→`--hair`; `.gauge-label`, `.muted`, `.empty`
  `--text-3`→`--muted`; `.callout-text` hardcoded `#3b352a`→`--ink`; `.callout-arrow`
  hardcoded `#bdb39a`→`--muted`; inline `--accent`→`--terra`, `--text-3`→`--muted` in
  `app.jsx`. The **legacy-remap block** removed from `y/tokens.css` — file now contains only
  canonical Broadsheet names. SW cache bumped to `yearly-v9`.
- **Spend curve note:** the spec §4 calls for Recharts, but this repo is deliberately
  self-contained/offline-first, so `SpendCurve` and `ProjectionChart` are dependency-free
  themed SVGs. Adopting the Recharts engine is an optional future decision.

## Running it

There is **no build, no package manager, no tests, no linter**. The app is a single static
HTML file that loads React + Babel from CDN and transpiles the `y/*.jsx` modules in the
browser.

- Serve the directory over HTTP and open `index.html` (e.g. `python -m http.server` then
  visit `http://localhost:8000/`). It will **not** work over `file://` — the `type="text/babel" src=`
  scripts require HTTP.
- State persists to `localStorage` under `yearly:store:v1`; on first load `buildSeed`
  creates a blank store (no transactions, no wishlist) with default year settings, people,
  and templates. To reset to a blank store, clear that key.
- The app is also hosted on GitHub Pages — `index.html` at the repo root serves as the PWA
  entry point.

### Local dev — no backend, no reload loop

The sync layer (`y/sync.jsx`) calls `/api/sync`, `/api/transactions`, and `/api/settings`.
These endpoints only exist on the production Cloudflare Worker. Running locally means every
sync call gets a 404 from the static file server. This is handled gracefully: `syncFetch`
treats 404 as a silent no-op (returns `null`) and never reloads the page — only 200-with-HTML
(Cloudflare Access login redirect) or 401/403 trigger a reload.

**If you see the app reloading every second** in the local preview, the likely cause is a
stale service worker whose precache contains an old `sync.jsx` that had the original
`location.reload()` on any non-JSON response. Fix:

1. Open DevTools → Application → Service Workers → click "Unregister".
2. Open DevTools → Application → Cache Storage → delete all `yearly-v*` caches.
3. Hard-reload (`Ctrl+Shift+R` / `Cmd+Shift+R`).

The new SW (once installed) uses `{cache: 'no-cache'}` when precaching, so this situation
should not recur after a version bump.

**`yearly:bootstrapped` is absent on a fresh origin** (e.g. localhost vs production). On
first load, `bootstrap()` tries `/api/sync?since=0`, gets a 404, and returns without setting
the key. The app still renders fine — bootstrap just silently no-ops on every load. The
localStorage keys only get populated when the app runs against the real backend.

### Self-contained (no external dependencies)
The app is fully self-contained — **no `_ds/` directory is needed**. The original Aperture
design system dependency has been replaced by two local files:

- **`y/tokens.css`** — defines the complete Broadsheet token set. No legacy remaps remain;
  all screens use canonical names. Loaded in `index.html` before `y/app.css`. See the
  "Visual layer" section above.
- **`y/ds.jsx`** — an IIFE that sets `window.ApertureDesignSystem_72a4cd = { Button,
  SegmentedControl, Input, Chip }`, matching exactly the props the app passes to each.
  Loaded after `y/icons.jsx` and before `y/ui.jsx` / screens.

If adding new DS component usages, update `y/ds.jsx` to match the props passed.

## Architecture

### Module system (no bundler)
Every `y/*.jsx` file is an IIFE that **reads its dependencies off `window` and attaches its
own export to `window`**. There are no imports/exports. Two consequences:

1. **Load order is significant** and is fixed in `index.html` (primitives → screens →
   root). If you add a module, add its `<script type="text/babel">` tag there in dependency
   order.
2. Cross-module calls go through the global namespace: `window.YData`, `window.YCalc`,
   `window.YSync`, `window.YUI`, `window.YFun`, `window.YHome`, `window.YAnalysis`,
   `window.YSettings`, `window.YAdd`, plus `window.Icon`/`window.YIcons`. Aperture components
   come from `window.ApertureDesignSystem_72a4cd`.

### The brain (port these first to any production target)
- `y/calc.jsx` (`window.YCalc`) — **all numbers come from here.** `computeStats(store, year, asOfDate?)`
  (linear projection + per-year buffer uplift + status thresholds; `asOfDate` defaults to `new Date()`)
  and `buildCallouts(store, stats)` (the ranked detector engine — 8 detectors). Pure functions, no UI deps.
  Also exports `cumulativeByDay(txns)` → `number[366]` (shared with `analysis.jsx`),
  `priorYearCumulative(store, year, asOfDate)` → number (prior year spend at same day-of-year),
  `rateForMonth(person, ym)` → number (latest applicable rate for a person in a "YYYY-MM"; 0 before startMonth),
  `computeFun(store, asOfDate?)` → per-person fun ledger (see below),
  `projectionAsOf` (trend detector), `requiredDailyToHit(stats)` → number|null (daily cap to finish on
  mainTarget; null when not applicable), and the standard formatters.
  **Vocabulary** (canonical names — never use `target` for the stored ceiling):
  - `ceiling` — `years[y].ceiling`, stored, user-set, sacred. Renamed from `target`.
  - `funPlanAnnual` — Σ people × 12 months × rateForMonth; derived.
  - `mainTarget` — `ceiling − funPlanAnnual`; derived, never stored. Non-discretionary budget.
  - `spent` / `projection` in stats — main (non-fun) only. Fun tx excluded from all main math.
  - `funSpent` / `funProjection` — fun YTD and linear projection (approximate, lumpy).
  - `combinedProjection` = `projection + funProjection`; `combinedDelta` / `combinedStatus` vs `ceiling`.
  `computeStats` returns: `ceiling`, `mainTarget`, `funPlanAnnual`, `funSpent`, `funProjection`,
  `combinedProjection`, `combinedDelta`, `combinedDeltaPct`, `combinedStatus` plus all existing fields
  (`spent`, `projection`, `delta`, `status`, etc. — all main-budget). `stats.txns` contains main-only
  tx (fun tx excluded); `stats.upto` is likewise main-only.
  `priorCum` (number[366] | null) and `priorSpent` (number | null) — prior year, main tx only.
  Future-year guard: spent 0, projection 0, status "good"; `isFuture` in returned stats.
  `buildCallouts` returns a single `{id:"future"}` callout for future years; `{id:"final"}` for
  complete years. For current year, detectors #1–7 describe the main budget; detector #8 (ceiling)
  is the sacred combined verdict, always prepended at the top:
  - over ceiling → watch/alert "trim fun ~€Y/mo"; drill {section:"fun"}.
  - comfortably under (< ceiling×0.94) → good/info "room to raise fun ~€Y/mo"; drill {section:"fun"}.
  When the ceiling callout is present it replaces the "calm" fallback.
  Detector #6 (yoy): current year only — compares main spent to prior year at same doy; watch/info/good.
  Detector #7 (reqpace): current year only, when projection > mainTarget — surfaces required daily spend cap.
  `computeFun(store, asOfDate?)` — exported, uses `store.currentYear` for YTD figures. Returns:
  `people[]` (per-person: `id`, `name`, `balance` all-time = accrued − spent + `balanceAdjustment`, `monthlyRate`, `usedThisMonth`,
  `spentAllTime`), `funSpentYTD`, `funProjection` (linear, approximate), `funCatList` (category breakdown).
- `y/data.jsx` (`window.YData`) — the persisted store shape, the fixed 18-category list
  (`CATEGORIES`, id→icon→color), default templates, and
  `loadStore`/`saveStore`/`resetStore`/`migrateStore`.
  **Store shape (fun-budget model):**
  - `store.people`: `[{id, name, rates:[{from:"YYYY-MM", amount}], startMonth:"YYYY-MM", balanceAdjustment?:number}]` — forward-only
    dated rate schedule per person. `balanceAdjustment` is an additive offset to the computed balance (set via "Correct balance" in Settings → Fun budget); 0 when absent. Default: Joseph €100/mo, Marti €200/mo.
  - `store.wishlist`: `[{id, owner, name, price, note?, createdMonth}]` — per-person wishlist items.
  - Transaction fields: optional `fun:true` and `person:"joseph"|"marti"` (only on fun tx).
    Optional Revolut-sourced fields: `merchant_logo` (URL string), `merchant_city` (string).
  - `years[y].ceiling` — renamed from `years[y].target` (sacred household ceiling, never derived).
  `buildSeed()` — returns a blank store: `transactions: []`, `wishlist: []`, default year ceilings
  (2024 €21k / 2025 €23k / 2026 €25k), default people rates, default templates. No sample data.
  `migrateStore(s)` (exported, idempotent): `years[y].target` → `ceiling`; injects `people` and
  `wishlist` defaults if missing; sets `density` default; normalizes all `transactions[*].category`
  to lowercase IDs (fixes Revolut title-case import: `"Groceries"` → `"groceries"`). Called by
  `loadStore` and by JSON restore.
  **`normalizeCategory(raw)`** (exported) — resolves any raw category string to a canonical lowercase
  ID. Handles: valid ID passthrough, title-case ID (`"Groceries"` → `"groceries"`), full label
  (`"House Stuff"` → `"house"`), unknown → `"general"`. Used by `cat()`, `rowToTx` in sync, and
  `aggregateByCategory`/`aggregateByMonth` in calc.
  **`uid()`** — `crypto.randomUUID()` (collision-safe across devices and reloads).

The README documents the exact projection formula, status thresholds, and each callout
detector. **If you change the math or detectors, update the README spec in the same change.**

### Sync layer (`y/sync.jsx`, `window.YSync`)
Loaded immediately after `y/data.jsx` (depends only on `YData` + `fetch`; must be before `app.jsx`).
Implements outbox-based client↔D1 sync with optimistic UI and offline-safe queuing.

**localStorage keys:**
- `yearly:sync:cursor` — server `now` timestamp from the last successful pull; used as `since=` in `GET /api/sync`.
- `yearly:outbox:v1` — JSON array of full tx records pending push; deduped by `id` keeping latest version.
- `yearly:settings:dirty` — `"1"` when any non-transactions store key has changed since last flush.
- `yearly:bootstrapped` — `"1"` after the one-time bootstrap completes; prevents re-seeding on reload.
- `yearly:settings:appliedAt` — `updated_at` of the last settings blob pulled from the server; prevents re-applying a blob we just pushed.

**Public API:**
- `YSync.init({ getStore, applyServer })` — called once on mount. `getStore()` returns the live store via a ref; `applyServer(updater)` maps to the app's `setStore`.
- `YSync.enqueueTx(record)` — dedupe-adds a tx (or delete record) to the outbox and schedules a flush.
- `YSync.markSettingsDirty()` — marks settings for push and schedules a flush. Called automatically from `app.jsx`'s `setStore` wrapper whenever only non-transactions keys change.
- `YSync.flush()` — push outbox in chunks of 75, then PUT settings if dirty. Captures the sent-id set before the POST so mutations enqueued mid-flight survive. Clears the dirty flag before the PUT and restores it on failure.
- `YSync.pull()` — calls `flush()` first (prevents golden-source pull from clobbering unsynced writes), then `GET /api/sync?since=cursor`, merges tx by id (deleted rows are removed), applies settings only when `updated_at > appliedAt`, updates cursor.
- `YSync.bootstrap()` — called once on mount. Pull-first: if server has data, adopt it (second-device path); if server is empty, push local seed + settings (first-device path). Sets `yearly:bootstrapped`.
- `YSync.start()` — wires `online`, `focus`, and `visibilitychange` → visible triggers.

**Auth-expiry vs offline:** `syncFetch()` wraps every `fetch` call. If the call throws (`TypeError`) it checks `navigator.onLine`: offline → return `null` silently; online → `location.reload()` (Cloudflare Access expiry as a cross-origin 302 CORS block). For non-throwing bad responses, only reloads on auth-expiry patterns: 200 with non-JSON body (Cloudflare Access login page redirect) or HTTP 401/403. 404 and 5xx return `null` silently — they indicate backend or local-dev issues, not auth expiry.

**Pull triggers:** on every mount (unconditional `bootstrap().then(() => pull())` in `app.jsx`), on `visibilitychange` → visible, and before `EditSheet` opens (freshness pull via `openEdit` wrapper in `app.jsx`). The `focus` event triggers `flush()` only (no full pull). `pull()` always flushes first so local changes are never overwritten by a server pull. On already-bootstrapped devices, `bootstrap()` is a no-op (returns immediately if `yearly:bootstrapped` is set); settings are compared by `updated_at > appliedAt` so only genuinely newer server settings overwrite local ones.

> **Why no `/api` calls appear on hard reload:** `bootstrap()` is gated by `yearly:bootstrapped` in
> localStorage — once set (after first ever sync), it returns immediately without any network call.
> The `focus` and `visibilitychange` listeners fire only when the window *gains* focus or the tab
> *becomes* visible after being hidden. A hard reload in an already-focused, already-visible tab
> triggers neither. To force a pull: switch away from the tab and back, or open an Edit sheet.

### State flow (`y/app.jsx`)
`App` is the single stateful root. `store` (persisted via a `setStore` that writes the whole
object to localStorage on every mutation) is the only durable state; `route` / `viewYear` /
`analysisFocus` / `addOpen` / `editTx` / `yearOpen` / `deletedTx` / `showToast` are ephemeral
UI state. Three memoized derivations drive everything visible:
`stats = YCalc.computeStats(store, viewYear)`, `callouts = YCalc.buildCallouts(store, stats)`,
and `fun = YCalc.computeFun(store)` (all-time per-person fun ledger, recomputed on any store
change). `onOpenFun` sets `analysisFocus = { section:"fun" }` and routes to Analysis → Fun tab.
`fun`, `store`, `setStore`, and `addTx` are passed to `AnalysisScreen` (for `FunTab`); `fun`,
`store`, and `onOpenFun` are passed to `HomeScreen` (for `FunStrip`). `store` is also passed to
`EditSheet` so it can read `store.people` for the fun toggle owner picker.

**Sync wiring in `app.jsx`:** on mount, `YSync.init({ getStore: () => storeRef.current, applyServer: setStore })` + `YSync.start()` + `YSync.bootstrap()`. `storeRef` is kept current via a `useEffect`. `addTx`/`saveTx` call `YSync.enqueueTx(tx)` after `setStore`; `delTx` enqueues `{ ...tx, deleted:true }`; `undoDelete` re-enqueues without `deleted`. Settings dirty is detected centrally inside `setStore`: when `next.transactions === prev.transactions` (reference unchanged → settings-only mutation) `window.YSync.markSettingsDirty()` is called. `openEdit` wraps `setEditTx` to call `YSync.pull()` before opening the edit sheet.

`density` (minimal/balanced/all) is persisted in `store.density` and controls how many callouts
the Overview shows. It is editable in Settings → Display → Overview density.

Undo-on-delete: `delTx(id)` stashes the removed transaction in `deletedTx` and raises
`showToast`. The `Toast` primitive (from `YUI`) auto-dismisses after 5 s; the "Undo" action
re-inserts `deletedTx` into the store.

Navigation is in-memory route state (`home` | `analysis` | `settings`), not URL routing.
Tapping a callout sets `analysisFocus = { section, category? }` and switches to Analysis,
which jumps to that tab and pre-expands the focused category. `viewYear` is independent of
`store.currentYear`; selecting a past year flips the app into "completed year" mode (final
spend, no projection/buffer).

### UI layers
- `y/ui.jsx` (`window.YUI`) — shared primitives: `StatusHero` (combined-vs-ceiling numerals
  hero — see below), `CalloutCard`, `TxRow`, `CatIcon`, `DeltaChip`, `Sheet`, `SectionH`,
  `Toast`, and `rich` (renders numbers inside text in the mono `.num` style).
  **`StatusHero`** leads with the sacred combined household number: headline =
  `combinedProjection` (current/complete) or `ceiling` (future); sub-line = over/under
  ceiling by €N (coloured by `combinedStatus`); pace rule fills to `combinedProjection/ceiling`
  with a day-of-year marker; a decomposition line shows `main €A / €mainTarget` (coloured by
  `stats.status`) and `fun €B` (ink-2). For complete years all projections equal spent.
  **`TxRow`** — shows a 24px rounded merchant logo (`t.merchant_logo`) when present; falls back
  to a 24px `cat-ic` category icon (colored square + SVG icon, `CatIcon`-style inline) if
  absent or on load error. `tx-meta` appends `· city` when `t.merchant_city` is set. Both
  fields are populated by `rowToTx` in `sync.jsx` from the Revolut D1 columns.
  **`SpendCurve`** (Overview chart) shows a household ceiling reference line (`--ink-2` dashed
  "6 3") in addition to the main-target line. Both are labeled inline; `maxY` scales to
  `max(mainTarget, ceiling, projection) × 1.08` so the ceiling is always visible.
  `Toast({ open, message, actionLabel, onAction, onDismiss })` — transient bottom-anchored
  banner (above nav, z-index 30), auto-dismisses after 5 s via `onDismiss`, optional action button.
  `GaugeHero`, `PaceBar`, and `ProjSpark` have been removed (dead since hero is fixed to numerals).
- `y/fun.jsx` (`window.YFun`) — fun budget UI module. Exports:
  `FunStrip({ fun, store, onOpen })` — compact Overview strip: one hairline row per person
  (name, all-time balance in sage/terra, nearest wishlist goal name+pct+thin bar). Whole strip
  tappable → `onOpen()`. "no goals yet" if no wishlist items. Broadsheet tokens only, no cards.
  `FunTab({ fun, store, setStore, addTx })` — the Analysis workshop:
  - Per-person cards: name, monthly rate, balance (large, sage/terra coloured), this-month used
    with over/under indicator, all-time fun spent.
  - Wishlist per person: item name, price, progress bar (clamped 0–100%, clamps negative balance
    to 0 for display), months-to-afford ETA (`max(0, ceil((price−balance)/rate))`; "ready now"
    if balance ≥ price; "—" if rate 0). "Bought it" button logs a fun-tagged shopping tx via
    `addTx` and removes the item from `store.wishlist`. Remove (✕) deletes without buying.
    "Add" button opens `WishlistAddSheet` (name, price, owner Chip picker) pre-set to that person.
  - Fun category breakdown: catbar-* rows fed from `fun.funCatList` (non-interactive).
  Internal: `WishlistAddSheet` (name + price + owner Chip picker), `PersonCard` (stats + wishlist).
- Screens: `y/home.jsx` (Overview — hero + callouts + FunStrip + spend curve),
  `y/analysis.jsx` (Projection/Categories/Activity/Fun tabs; charts are hand-built SVG that
  double as the Recharts spec), `y/settings.jsx`
  (ceiling/buffer/years/fun-budget/density/templates/CSV import-export/JSON backup-restore/clear),
  `y/addflow.jsx` (Quick keypad + Manual add, Edit sheet, category picker, fun toggle).
  `analysis.jsx` — `AnalysisScreen` receives `fun`, `store`, `setStore`, `addTx` in addition to
  `stats`/`focus`/`onEditTx`; renders `<YFun.FunTab>` on the "Fun" segment; focus effect handles
  `focus.section === "fun"` → `setTab("Fun")`. **ProjectionChart** now shows a household ceiling
  line (`--ink-2` dashed "6 3", labeled "ceiling €Xk") above the main-target line; `maxY` scales
  to `max(mainTarget, ceiling, projection, priorMax) × 1.1`. **CategoriesTab** catbar rows use
  `CatIcon` (24px, radius 6); expanding a category shows the last 5 transactions using `TxRow` with
  `onClick → onEditTx` so they are clickable (opens the same edit sheet as the Activity tab).
  `addflow.jsx` — both `AddSheet` and `EditSheet` expose a **Fun budget toggle** (pill switch, off by
  default). When on, a Chip owner picker (Joseph/Marti) appears. `commit()`/`save()` write `fun:true`
  + `person` when the toggle is on; EditSheet pre-populates toggle state from `txn.fun`/`txn.person`.
  `EditSheet` now accepts a `store` prop for reading `store.people`.
  `settings.jsx` — footer shows `APP_VERSION` constant (`'v16'` currently, defined at top of
  IIFE — update it with every release). `TargetSheet` (now labelled "Household ceiling") and `BufferSheet` accept a `year`
  prop (defaults to `store.currentYear`); `TargetSheet` reads/writes `years[y].ceiling`. `BufferSheet`
  computes its own stats internally (unchanged). `YearsSheet` has tappable year rows that drill into a
  year detail view (ceiling + buffer rows), plus an "Add year" button that clones the most recent year's
  ceiling/buffer into `year+1`. Future years with no transactions can be deleted from the detail view.
  Year list rows show `st.ceiling` + `st.combinedProjection` + `DeltaChip(combinedDelta, combinedStatus)`.
  **"Fun budget" section** — one `Row` per person opens `FunConfigSheet`, which sets the person's monthly
  rate for the current YYYY-MM (forward-only: appends/updates a `rates[]` entry, never modifies past
  entries, keeps `rates` sorted) and optionally corrects the balance: "Correct balance…" toggle reveals
  a "Set balance to €X" input that back-calculates and stores `p.balanceAdjustment` so the displayed
  balance equals the entered value, with future accruals and spending applied on top.
  The derived split is shown inline: `ceiling = main + fun/yr`.
  `DensitySheet` — a picker for Overview density (minimal/balanced/all); writes to `store.density`.
  **JSON backup/restore**: "Restore (JSON)" calls `YData.migrateStore(parsed)` before `setStore` so
  old backups (with `target`, no `people`/`wishlist`) migrate cleanly. Hidden `#jsonfile` input mirrors
  the CSV `#csvfile` pattern. **"Sync now"** row in the Data section calls `YSync.pull()` on demand
  (shows "Syncing…" while in flight). "Restore sample data" has been removed.
  Focus routing: `AnalysisScreen` focus useEffect handles `"categories"` → Categories, `"projection"` →
  Projection, `"activity"` → Activity, `"fun"` → Fun.
- `y/icons.jsx` — inline-SVG Lucide-style icon set via `<Icon name=… />`.
- `y/tokens.css` — CSS custom property definitions (all ~25 tokens `app.css` consumes).
- `y/ds.jsx` (`window.ApertureDesignSystem_72a4cd`) — local `Button`, `SegmentedControl`,
  `Input`, `Chip` primitives styled with the tokens.
- `y/app.css` — **the styling source of truth** (layout, the mobile device column, the
  visual system), built on Aperture dark tokens. The `.ds-btn`, `.ds-seg`, `.ds-input`,
  `.ds-chip` classes at the bottom style the DS primitives from `y/ds.jsx`.
  **Font baseline:** `body { font-family: var(--sans); }` + `button, input, select, textarea
  { font-family: inherit; }` ensure the sans font flows everywhere; `.sheet-head h3` and
  `.tx-desc` also carry an explicit `font-family: var(--sans)`. Without these, browsers use
  their UA serif default (Times New Roman) on headings and button descendants.
- `y/tweaks-panel.jsx` — **deleted** (Session 8). Was already unloaded from `index.html`
  in Session 7; confirmed zero references remained before removal.

## Backend (Cloudflare Workers + D1)

The app is hosted on Cloudflare Workers with a D1 SQLite database. Static files live in
`public/`; Worker entry point is `src/index.js`; config is `wrangler.jsonc`. Live at
**https://yearly.josepharari.com** behind Cloudflare Access (Google SSO).

### D1 schema (`migrations/`)

Two tables, applied via `npx wrangler d1 migrations apply yearly-db --remote`:

```sql
-- 0001_init.sql
transactions(id TEXT PK, date TEXT NOT NULL, description TEXT,
             amount_eur REAL NOT NULL, category TEXT NOT NULL,
             note TEXT, source TEXT,
             fun INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0, person TEXT,
             original_amount REAL, original_currency TEXT,
             deleted INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0, updated_at INTEGER NOT NULL)
-- idx_tx_updated on updated_at for efficient sync queries

-- 0002_revolut_fields.sql (added columns for Revolut-sourced data)
-- revolut_category TEXT, merchant_mcc TEXT, merchant_city TEXT,
-- merchant_country TEXT, merchant_logo TEXT, card_label TEXT,
-- tx_type TEXT, e_commerce INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0, fee_eur REAL

settings(id INTEGER PK CHECK(id=1), blob TEXT, updated_at INTEGER)
-- single row; blob is a JSON-serialised settings object
```

`amount_eur` is stored as `REAL` (mirrors the JS field directly). `fun`, `deleted`, and
`e_commerce` are `0`/`1` integers. `updated_at` is a **server-stamped ms epoch** on every write.
`"migrations_dir": "migrations"` is set in `wrangler.jsonc`'s `d1_databases[0]`.

### API endpoints (`src/index.js`)

All under `/api/*`. Server clock is authoritative; every write stamps `updated_at = Date.now()`.

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/api/health` | `{ok:true,db:true}` — DB connectivity check |
| `GET` | `/api/sync?since=<ms>` | Pull: `{now, transactions:[rows with updated_at>=since], settings:row|null}` |
| `POST` | `/api/transactions` | Batch upsert array of tx records; returns `{now, count}` |
| `GET` | `/api/settings` | `{blob:{…}, updated_at}` or `{blob:null}` |
| `PUT` | `/api/settings` | Upsert settings blob; returns `{now, updated_at}` |
| `GET` | `/api/export` | Full dump: `{exported_at, transactions:[all incl. deleted], settings}` |

Key implementation notes:
- `GET /api/sync` uses `>=` (not `>`) to avoid dropping a write on the same-ms boundary.
- `POST /api/transactions` coerces absent/falsy `deleted` → `0` explicitly (reliable un-delete).
- `fun` boolean → `0/1` on write; client reconstructs `fun:true`/omit on read.
- Body validation: array required, each item must have a string `id`; returns 400 otherwise.
- Uses `env.DB.batch([...])` for the upsert array.

## PWA (offline + install)

The app is a fully installable PWA:

- **`sw.js`** (repo root) — **network-first** service worker. On every fetch it tries the
  network; on success it writes the response to cache and returns it. On network failure it
  serves from cache. This means users always get fresh content when online and the app still
  runs when offline. Precaches the full app shell on install (all `y/*.jsx`, `y/*.css`,
  `manifest.json`, `index.html`, and the three pinned CDN URLs for React/ReactDOM/Babel).
  **Cache-versioning rule:** bump `CACHE_NAME` in `sw.js` whenever the shell changes (new
  file added to the precache list, CDN URL pinned to a new version, etc.). The old cache is
  deleted on `activate`. `skipWaiting()` + `clients.claim()` ensure the new SW takes over
  immediately without waiting for old tabs to close.
  **Install hardening:** the install handler uses individual `fetch({cache:'no-cache'}).catch()` calls instead
  of `cache.addAll` so a single URL failure does not abort the entire SW install, and `no-cache` ensures the install always fetches fresh files (bypassing browser HTTP cache). Same `!response.redirected` guard
  applied in the install handler as in the fetch handler. Current version: `yearly-v16`.
  **Logo caching:** merchant logo requests (`storage.googleapis.com/revolut-prod-apps_merchant-logo/…`)
  are intercepted with a **cache-first** strategy using a dedicated `yearly-logos-v1` cache.
  Once a logo is fetched it is never re-fetched. The logo cache is intentionally NOT deleted on
  app version bumps (logos are stable per URL). All other requests remain network-first.
- **`manifest.json`** — includes `id`, `scope`, `start_url`, and an `icons` array with
  192×192, 512×512, and a maskable 512×512 variant (all SVG). SVG icons work in Chrome 91+
  and modern WebKit/Firefox; for production Android/iOS you would swap in PNGs.
- **`icons/icon.svg`** — flat accent-blue (#0071e3) tile with white "Y." wordmark and iOS-
  style rounded corners (rx 115). Used for both 192 and 512 manifest entries.
- **`icons/icon-maskable.svg`** — same design, full bleed (no rx), content within the inner
  80% safe zone so the OS mask never clips the wordmark. Used for the `"purpose": "maskable"`
  manifest entry.
- **`index.html`** registers the SW at the end of `<body>` with feature detection
  (`if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) navigator.serviceWorker.register('sw.js')`).
  Also adds `<link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="icons/icon.svg">` for iOS home-screen icons.

> After any `sw.js` change: hard-refresh and confirm the new SW activated in
> DevTools → Application → Service Workers before investigating anything else (§7 CLAUDE.md).

## Conventions

- **Broadsheet light theme** (mid-migration; some screens still light-remapped from the old
  Aperture dark tokens — see "Visual layer" above). Figures render in the monospace `.num`
  (JetBrains Mono) style; the hero display number is serif; UI/body text is the sans. No
  emoji, no verdict adjectives, no monthly-budget framing — the year is the unit. (Full token
  table and voice rules in the README + `design/BROADSHEET_DESIGN_SPEC.md`.)
- Amounts are positive EUR, stored rounded to cents; year is derived from `date.slice(0,4)`;
  actuals are always computed from transactions, never stored as aggregates.
- Match the surrounding inline-style + className idiom already in each file; there is no CSS
  framework or class generator beyond `app.css` and the Aperture tokens.

## Regression test

**`calc.test.html`** (repo root) — a standalone HTML page that loads `y/data.jsx` +
`y/calc.jsx` as plain `<script>` tags (no Babel needed; neither file has JSX). Serves as
a smoke-test for the engine: open over HTTP (`http://localhost:8000/calc.test.html`) and all
rows should show PASS. Not precached by `sw.js` (dev artifact only). Run it after any
change to `y/calc.jsx` or `y/data.jsx`.
